The statement & testcases
=========================

----------
Statements
----------

HHSOJ-Essential supports two kinds of statements: PDF and Markdown.
The Markdown version should have a name ``statement.md`` and the PDF version should have a name ``statement.pdf``.
You can include either or both. The system will auto detect.

-----
Tests
-----

Each testcase should be in exactly one subtask.
Input files have the format ``test<x>.in`` and output files have the format ``test<x>.out``.
``<x>`` starts from 0. They will be judged in increasing order of ``<x>``
